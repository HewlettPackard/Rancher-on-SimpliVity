# Rancher on HPE SimpliVity

## Deployment guide

The Reference Configuration for Rancher on HPE SimpliVity is part of an overall
solution from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The solution playbooks deploy Rancher on a highly available
Kubernetes admin cluster along with a number of supporting nodes external to the cluster, for load balancing and DHCP services. The playbooks also deploy an example user cluster with optional CSI storage

The playbooks are avaible at [https://github.com/HewlettPackard/Rancher-on-SimpliVity](https://github.com/HewlettPackard/Rancher-on-SimpliVity).
