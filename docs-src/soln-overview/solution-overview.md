# Solution overview

This Reference Configuration for Rancher on HPE SimpliVity is part of an overall
solution from Hewlett Packard Enterprise. The solution playbooks deploy Rancher on a highly available
Kubernetes admin cluster and a number of supporting nodes, together with an
example user cluster with optional CSI storage
([Solution configuration](solution-configuration)).


**Kubernetes** is an orchestration system for managing container-based applications. Kubernetes empowers developers to
utilize new architectures like microservices and serverless that require developers to think about application operations
in a way they may not have before. These software architectures can blur the lines between traditional development and
application operations ([Kubernetes overview](containers-k8s-devops)).

**Rancher** is a complete software stack for teams adopting containers. It addresses the operational and security
challenges of managing multiple Kubernetes clusters across any infrastructure (bare metal, private clouds, public clouds or
vSphere), while providing DevOps teams with integrated tools for running containerized workloads 
([Rancher overview](rancher-overview)).

**HPE SimpliVity** is an enterprise-grade hyper-converged platform uniting best-in-class data services with the world's
best-selling server ([HPE SimpliVity overview](simplivity-overview)).
