# Executive summary

Software development in the enterprise is undergoing rapid and widespread change. Application architectures are moving
from monolithic and N-tier to cloud-native microservices while the development process has transitioned from waterfall
through agile to a DevOps focus. Meanwhile, deployments have moved from the data center to hosted environments
and now the cloud (public, private, and hybrid) and release cycles have shrunk from quarterly to weekly,
or even more frequently. To remain competitive, businesses require functionality to be delivered in a faster
and more streamlined manner, while facing ever-increasing security threats.
